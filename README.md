# Resilience Validation

This repository stores the scripts I have used to work on the resilience validation project. 

This project is about using EM-DAT databse with Eurostat to validate resilience using the Resilience Inference Measurement method. 

Novelty: made a function to geolocate EM-DAT database and made a function to select the best available data (year and region) from Eurostat.
